 # script starts here

// comments writes with double slash. Yeah, it's not logical, but it's good enough //
 # we can also comment inline by hash, like in Bash, or in Python

 # assigning binary value as string
here:binary = "Hello world".;
here:read;

 # it outputs something more, but "Hello world" appears

 # end of the script, or I could use 'exit'
